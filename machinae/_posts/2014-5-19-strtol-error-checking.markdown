# String to Number Conversion in C Takes its Toll

Converting a string to a number in C is no simple affair. Many of you may have heard of
[atoi(3)][atoi]; one of the ways to convert a string to a number.  Unfortunately, modern thinking
says that `atoi` should never be used, and so it's use is [discouraged][atoi-discouraged]. Instead,
we now have `strtol`. [^strtol-and-friends]

## What's wrong with atoi?

The reason for discouraging use of `atoi` stems from the fact that there is no way to detect if
overflow or underflow has occurred, and no way to check if the entire string has been converted (aka
there's no way to detect `atoi("123garbage")`).  Consider the following code:

{% highlight c %}
// 2^32+1, assuming 32-bit int
const char *uintmax_plus_one = "4294967297";
printf("%d\n", atoi(uintmax_plus_one));
{% endhighlight %}

When run instead of printing `4294967296` as expected, this program will print `1`! The
vast majority of programs do not check for or properly handle this case, and so you can end up with
situations like the following:

{% highlight c %}
// 2^32+1, assuming 32-bit int
const char *uintmax_plus_one = "4294967297";
malloc(atoi(uintmax_plus_one));
{% endhighlight %}

Now we're allocating far less memory than we expected. This problem can quickly become the source
of an [integer overflow][integer-overflow] vulnerability.

## Enter strtol!

In order to do the conversion safely, we instead should use `strtol`. It is unfortunately quite
difficult to call this function properly. Consider the following documentation pulled from the
BSD Library Functions Manual's section on `strtol`:

> The strtol(), strtoll(), strtoimax(), and strtoq() functions return the result
> of the conversion, unless the value would underflow or overflow.  If no
> conversion could be performed, 0 is returned and the global variable errno is
> set to EINVAL (the last feature is not portable across all platforms).  If an
> overflow or underflow occurs, errno is set to ERANGE and the function return
> value is clamped according to the following table.
>
> | Function    | underflow  | overflow   |
> |:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
> | strtol()    | LONG_MIN   | LONG_MAX   |
> | strtoll()   | LLONG_MIN  | LLONG_MAX  |
> | strtoimax() | INTMAX_MIN | INTMAX_MAX |
> | strtoq()    | LLONG_MIN  | LLONG_MAX  |
> {: .neat }

Based on this, the two ways to check for an overflow are to check if `strtol` returns 0 or to
check if `errno` is set to `ERANGE`. There's another simple case where `strtol` returns 0
specifically if the input string to `strtol` is `"0"`, so in order to accurately detect range errors,
we must check for `ERANGE`. This isn't quite so simple either however, as if no error has occurred,
`strtol` will not change the value of `errno`. If this happens, and some previous code has set
`errno` to `ERANGE` you will erroneously think that a range error has occurred. So now in order to
check for range errors you must reset `errno` to a value that indicates that no error has occurred.
Now, what value is that? Thankfully, [POSIX.1-2008][POSIX] has considered this possibility, and
defined that "No function in this volume of POSIX.1-2008 shall set errno to 0," meaning that no
error in all of POSIX will have the value 0. So now we can do the following:

{% highlight c %}
errno = 0;
long val = strtol(str, NULL, 10);
if (errno == ERANGE) {
	switch(val) {
	case LONG_MIN:
		// underflow
		break;
	case LONG_MAX:
		// overflow
		break;
	default:
		assert(false); // impossible
	}
} else if (errno != 0) {
	// something else happened. die die die
}
{% endhighlight %}

But wait, there's more! This works fine for detecting range errors, but fails to detect garbage at
the end of the string. Thankfully, `strtol` lets us handle this too via it's `char **endptr` argument.

> If endptr is not NULL, strtol() stores the address of the first invalid
> character in \*endptr.  If there were no digits at all, however, strtol()
> stores the original value of str in \*endptr.  (Thus, if \*str is not \`\\0'
> but \*\*endptr is \`\\0' on return, the entire string was valid.)

Using this, we can detect if there was garbage at the end of the string by passing in a `char **`
value for `endptr`.

{% highlight c %}
errno = 0;
char *endptr;
long val = strtol(str, &endptr, 10);
if (errno == ERANGE) {
	switch(val) {
	case LONG_MIN:
		// underflow
		break;
	case LONG_MAX:
		// overflow
		break;
	default:
		assert(false); // impossible
	}
} else if (errno != 0) {
	// something else happened. die die die
} else if (*endptr != '\\0') {
	// garbage at end of string
}
{% endhighlight %}

And now we've turned a relatively simple one-line call to `atoi` into twenty lines of code. [FML]

## Enter strtonum

The great folks over at [OpenBSD] have made a nice replacement for `strtol` which fixes all of the
issues discussed. Called [strtonum], the function doesn't allow trailing characters and makes it
easy to determine if a range error has occurred. The one drawback is that `strtonum` is an OpenBSD
extension, and so is not found in any standard. If you want to use `strtonum` on other platforms,
you can grab the source [here][strtonum-src].

[^strtol-and-friends]: `strtol`, short for "string to long" is only one of a few of such functions
	for converting from a string to a number. Also in this family are [strtoimax][strtol],
	[strtoll][strtol] and [strtoq][strtol].
